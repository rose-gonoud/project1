Our Project is to uncover patterns in the effects that the legalization of weed has on overall crime. 

We will choose 3 legalized cities and 3 non legal cities.
    Legal Cities:
        Portland, OR
        Colorado Springs, CO
        Riverside, CA

    Non-Legal Cities of comparable size
        New York, NY
        Fort Worth, TX
        Norfolk, VI

The above cities were chosen on the basis of similar violent crime rates as standardized per 100,000 people

In each city we will examine pre and post legalization for a comparison.
   1. How has violent crime rate been affected by legalization?
   2. How have particular cities' violent crime rates been affected by state legalization? (pre and post leaglization analysis within each of our three legalized cities)
   3. Another research question here based on what the data shows us!

Possible Sources of Data would be...
    Wikipedia for State information
    Crime Database of Cities chosen
